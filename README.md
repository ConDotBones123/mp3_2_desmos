For Python 3.10.11. Requires librosa.

Open the file you want to convert to a desmos graph, and then it will generate the necessary frequency and amplitude values. To use them, paste the following two equations into a desmos graph:

F\left(x\right)=\left[\right]
A\left(x\right)=\left[\right]

Copy the frequency values into the brackets for F(x) and the amplitude values into the brackets for A(x). Then use tone(F(T),A(T)) and let T increase by 20 every second(using a ticker) to play the song.
